# bios-wired-ctf--challenges

solution and what I understood


### 1) LIFETIMESETLLEMENT : 
i went into the site of d-code and pasted the cipher and searched which cipher and found out it was spoon cipher then d-coded the message using spoon decoder and found the flag

#### Learnt : learnt about spoon cipher 


### 2)BEEP-BOOP :
i found the sound outputed as morse ncode by hearing and then i tried to record the whole thing and find the flag but i couldn"t do it . then for 2 to 3 hours i learnt whole morse code and i slowly deciphered the whole thing

#### Learnt : learnt morse code 


### 3)DA_FRENCH_CIPHER :
i tryed the cipher analyzer first then began to the found cipher but couldn"t find the answer. the after guessing on my own (the first text is wired and the letter goes on increasing at 0,3,7,9,11,19 position and it goes on like that in the whole cipher) 

#### Learnt : learnt about french cipher


### 4)GREP_IT :
tryed to open the file using text editor and searched flag in the file and found the flag

#### Learnt : nothing(after coming to bios finished the same task in the actual way by using grep_it and found the flag)


### 5)CEASER_CIPHER :
as per the heading i searched in google and found about ceaser cipher and d-coded it.

#### Learnt : learnt ceaser cipher 


### 6)DOZEN_IS_KEY :
as per the instruction i download the file and tryed to the file using text editor. after the searched for the wired and found the flag but it was in encrypted so i d-code it by ceaser cipher.

#### Learnt : learnt ceaser cipher.


### 7)CHAN'S FAVORITE:
downloaded the file and opened it in audacity(in the hint) and did try to change the pitch and tune of the sound but didnt find and then i searched in the google and found out the way of d-coding it by using spectrogram and found the flag.

#### Learnt: using audio we ccan hide images and it can be decoded using spectrogram


### 8)DOTS&DASHES:
resized the audio and took only the morse code part and d-code  the cipher


### 9)FIND_THYSELF:
download the picture searched it in google using google lens and found the country as italy


### 10)wifi-hacking:
opened the file in wired-shark and found the wifi which we needed the password and found out the password in a decoded format. in terminal using aircrack-ng and dictornary attack to crack the password (i used a video for reference for finding the solution.)

#### Learnt: crack a wifi


### 11)LOGIC: 
i know the differnt types of gates and the transmition pattern threy do (12th physics) and found out the solution

#### Learnt: differnt types of gates in logical circuit.
